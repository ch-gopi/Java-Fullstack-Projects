Design a SQL database schema for a Food Delivery and Review System with the following use cases.
Use cases
1. A platform hosting multiple restaurants, each with its unique identifier, menu, pricing, and operating hours
2. Each restaurant can operate in multiple location with different delivery charges and taxes
3. Customers from various locations can place Orders containing multiple dishes from multiple restaurants. The Order tracks the Dish details,quantities, price,taxes, 
delivery charges and delivery status
4. Customers can also rate and review each Dish from a restaurant and these ratings and reviews are visible to all the Customers.
5. A loyalty and rewards program for Customers, with tracking of points earned and redeemed.
6. A system for handling order cancellations, charges and refunds.
1.create tables
 - Restaurants
  -Locations
  -Customers
  -Dishes
  -Orders
  - Reviews
  -LoyalityPoints
  -OrderCancellations

2.add pk and attributes
 -Restaurants(RestID,uniqueidentifier, menu, pricing, operating hours)
 -Locations(locationid,locationname,deliverycharge,tax)
  -Customers(customerid,customername,address)
  -Dishes(dishid,dishname,price)
  -Orders(orderid,quantity,delivery status)
  - Reviews(reviewid,rating)
  -LoyalityPoints(lpid,earnpo,redpoi)
  -OrderCancellations(ordecanid,charge,refund)


3.relation mapping b/w tables
   -resta:loca=1:m
   -di:res=m:m
   -cus-loc=m:m
   - ord:dis=m:m
   -ord:res:m:1
   -cus:rev=m:1
   -loy:cus=1:m
   -ord:cu=m:1

4.add fk and indexes
  -Restaurants(RestID,uniqueidentifier, menu, pricing, operating hours)
 -Locations(locationid,locationname,deliverycharge,tax,resid)
  -Customers(customerid,customername,address,loypoid,revid)
  -Dishes(dishid,dishname,price)
  -Orders(orderid,quantity,delivery status,resid)
  - Reviews(reviewid,rating)
  -LoyalityPoints(lpid,earnpo,redpoi)
  -OrderCancellations(ordecanid,charge,refund,custid)

lookuptable:
  -disrest(disresid,dishid,restid)
  -custloc(cusid,locid)
  - orddis(orid,disid)
